Some Apps implemented by Node.js

The weather-app provides a simple interface and server for user to look up the weather of a certain place by providing the location. MapboxAPI and WeatherstackAPI are used to fetch location and weather data.

It is deployed on Heroku; you can play around with it via https://daniel-wei-weather-application.herokuapp.com/
